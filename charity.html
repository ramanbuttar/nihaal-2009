                <p>Founded in 1952, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada aims to educate individuals about the prevention and management of heart disease and strokes. In addition, this volunteer-based health charity promotes healthy living  by providing funding for medical research and organizing numerous community programs.</p>
                <br />
                <p>As of 2008, the Heart and Stroke Foundation has raised more than $1 billion for heart and stroke research and since the Foundation does not receive  any operational funding from federal or provincial governments, it has to rely on the generous donations of millions of Canadians. Therefore, in an effort to provide some monetary assistance, partial proceeds of Nihaal 2009 will be donated to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of BC &amp; Yukon. If you are interested in donating directly to the Foundation's cause, <a href="http://www.heartandstroke.bc.ca/site/c.kpIPKXOyFmG/b.3644349/k.C227/Donate.htm">contact</a> one of their offices near you.</p>
                <br />
                <p>As this organization has rallied and inspired an entire nation to be more health-conscious and reduce the impact of cardiovascular disease, the SFU and UBC SSAs hopes to inspire our peers to take part in similar worthy causes.</p>
                <br />
